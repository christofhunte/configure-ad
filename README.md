</p>
<p>
First step I did was create a Resource Group in Azure and titled it "Active-Directory-Lab".
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cRjq0oK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Next step I did was create a virtual network and subnet for the virtual machines to run on. I placed the virtual network in the the Resource Group I created.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
I then created a virtual machine for the domain controller and titled it "dc-1". I set its operating system to Windows Server 2022 with the username "chlabuser". I also set it's size to 2 vcpus with a 16 GiB memory to be certain the server can handle all that I will be doing going forward.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zohJrYl.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I created another virtul machine for the client titled "client-1". I gave it the same Username and password as "dc-1" for lab purposes. I attached it to the same virtual network and resource group as "dc-1" and used Windows 10 (22H2) for the image.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W34r5bK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I set Domain Controller’s NIC Private IP address to be static so that when I set Client-1's DNS settings to DC-1's private IP address, there wouldn't be any change which would cause confusion later navigating client-1's server.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SFb3rhZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Next step was to copy DC-1's public IP address and log into the server with remote desktop (Microsoft Remote Desktop).
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8a9RxPi.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
In the DC-1 server I disabled the Windows Firewall so that I can test connectivity betwwen the two virtual machines.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cejX7jx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Next step was to add new inbound and outbound security rules to the Network security group of both Virtual Machines so that I will be able to override the deafult security rules with a higher priority one. This will enable to to set Client-1's DNS settings to DC-1's Private IP. I then restarted DC-1 and Client-1 virtual machines in the Azure Portal.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EnEBImq.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
In the DNS settings of CLient-1's VM on the Azure portal, I set it to DC-1's Private IP address. I then restarted the Client-1 virtual machine in the Azure Portal.
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RHBIXbF.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Next I logged into the Client-1 virtual machine and attempted to ping DC-1's private IP address in PowerShell. After ensuring the ping succeeded I ran "ipconfig /all" to see if the output for the DNS settings would show DC-1's private IP.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FvxORVA.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I then logged into DC-1 virtual machine and installed Active Directory Domain Services.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nWUqtnP.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Next step was to promote DC-1 to a domain controller. Afterwards I set up a new forest as "mydomain.com".
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9z84LFl.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I then restarted DC-1 and logged back in as user: "mydomain.com\chlabuser".
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CWC8dEQ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
In Active Directory Users and Computers, I created an Organizational Unit called “_EMPLOYEES” and another called  “_ADMINS”. I then created a new employee named “Jane Doe” with the username of “jane_admin” and same password used for both virtual machines. I then added jane_admin to the “Domain Admins” Security Group. I then logged out of the Domain Controller and will be using “mydomain.com\jane_admin" from now on to log in as an administrator.
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Gh175x4.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
The next step was to log into the Client-1 vm as the original local admin (chlabuser) and join to to the domain contoller. The computer restarted afterwards. Next I Logged into the Domain Controller and verified the Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers. Aftwerwards I Created a new OU named “_CLIENTS” and dragged Client-1 into it.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kn80Mcq.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I logged into Client-1 as mydomain.com\jane_admin, opened "Remote Desktop" in system properties, and gave "domain users" access to remote desktop. This will allow me to now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5Tb3Lm8.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I logged into DC-1 as jane_admin, opened PowerShell_ise as an administrator, created a new file and ran a script that created a bunch of user accounts in the "_EMPLOYEES" Organizational Unit. I then took one of the random user accounts and logged into Client-1 with that user account and the new password I created in the script.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zOXRqEd.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I opened Group Policy Management Editor in DC-1 and changed the account lockout policies such as initiating an account lockout after 5 invalid attempts, allowing administrator account lockout, setting the account lockout duration to 30 minutes.I then opened "Command Prompt" in Windows and initiated a gpudate /force.
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aciiDiK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I then attempted to log into Client-1 with the random user account and deliberate incorrect passwords. After 5 attempts my account was locked since I set the parameters in the GPO to do that.
</p>
<br />

<p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/scgBbC2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I logged into DC-1 as jane_admin and observed the account was locked and then I unlocked it all within the Active Directory.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/scgBbC2.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I logged into DC-1 as jane_admin and observed the account was locked and then I unlocked it all within the Active Directory. I attempted to login again and it worked.
</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GkRQBP0.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I stayed in the Active Directory and disabled the same account. I attempted to login and I saw the error message. I then re-enabled the account in the Active Directory and successfully logged in.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/KPIGulK.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
I reset the password of the same user within the Active Directory.
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Finally I used the Event Viewer to observe the logs in the Domain Controller and client machine. 
</p>
